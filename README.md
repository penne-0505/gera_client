# gera_client

This is still a project in progress, and it probably won't be completed, but I'll note down my current ideas.

GERA is an application that allows you to play and manage radio (podcast) hosted by Japanese comedians on your computer and web. Currently, there are no plans to implement account synchronization with smartphones. Also, since most of the resources needed for the app (audio files, episode information, etc.) are obtained through absolute values, strings, and html element selection, if there is even a slight change in the source of information, this will break. This project will probably be remade in another language.
